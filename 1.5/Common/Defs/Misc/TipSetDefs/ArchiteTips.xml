            <li TKey="ArchiteReinforcement.Tip.DiminishingReturns">The more upgrade points somebody has spent, the more archites they will need to earn a new point.</li>
            <li TKey="ArchiteReinforcement.Tip.ArtifactLevels">Archite pods and cells guarantee a full level of upgrade, making them highly valuable to those that have spent many upgrade points already.</li>
            <li TKey="ArchiteReinforcement.Tip.UpgradesAreRequired">Archites and upgrade points are useless to those who have not yet received an upgrade from an archite pod or cell.</li>

            <li TKey="ArchiteReinforcement.Tip.EnemiesWithArchites">Some of the people you encounter may already be enhanced with archites. They can make powerful foes... or allies.</li>
            <li TKey="ArchiteReinforcement.Tip.ArchiteSpawningPointAllocation">Archite-enhanced raiders vary greatly in ability. They can be relatively normal fighters, or lethal killing machines.</li>
